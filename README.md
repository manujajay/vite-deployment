2. **Preview the Build Locally:**
   - Before deploying, you can preview the build using Vite's preview command:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Choose a Deployment Platform:**
   - Options for deployment include Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages. The steps will vary based on the platform chosen. Here we will cover deploying to Netlify.
